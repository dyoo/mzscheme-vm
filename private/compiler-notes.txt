Notes on what the compiler's doing for each bytecode.


During compilation, we need to keep a mapping from indirect names to
the lambda values.  An indirect is a lambda without closed variables.
The compiler needs to generate labels on-the-fly.





(compilation-top prefix form)


What this needs to do:

    Write out the indirects.

    Install the prefix onto the value stack.

    Emit the code for the body.
