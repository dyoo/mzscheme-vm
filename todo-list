This is a list of stuff that needs to get done


*** High Priority ***
Test/debug current jsworld (need bootstrap functionality)
  Bugs:
    when using text inputs, manual poll (interval) doesn't stop with stop-when, gets an error first
Get primitives tested using PLT test suite
Get WeScheme running with MzScheme VM as backend


** Medium Priority **
Get effects working in jsworld again
Rewrite jsworld to work with cooperative and reentrant big-bangs


* Low Priority *
Change printing of chars and byte strings so that it properly displays non-printable characters (as #\<number>)
