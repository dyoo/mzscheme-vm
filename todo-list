    programs Emmanuel sends us
Make sure all errors are emitting reasonable locations

Add in missing jsworld procedures (on-mouse, on-mouse!, image-rotate)
Fix on-key for non-alpha-numeric keys (already works for \t, \b, enter, space, up, down, left, right)
Make hash tables display contents when printing


* Low Priority *
Change printing of chars and byte strings so that it properly displays non-printable characters (as #\<number>)
