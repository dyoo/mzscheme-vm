Test/debug current jsworld (need bootstrap functionality)

*** High Priority ***
Get primitives tested using PLT test suite

Get effects working in jsworld again
Rewrite jsworld to work with cooperative and reentrant big-bangs
Add in missing jsworld procedures (on-mouse, on-mouse!, image-rotate)
Fix extraneous manual poll (after world stops) on text inputs (around line 1180 in jsworld/jsworld.js)


* Low Priority *
