This is a list of stuff that needs to get done


**** Very High Priority **** (stuff Emmanuel needs)
Fully test the following:
    on-redraw
    programs Emmanuel sends us
Make sure all errors are emitting reasonable locations
Be able to save, publish, and run programs in WeScheme
Test for correctness on IE 6, IE 7, and IE 8
Robustly test all non-world primitives


*** High Priority ***
Get primitives tested using PLT test suite
Test for performance on different platforms
Get effects working in jsworld again


** Medium Priority **
Get newlines to display properly with js-text
Rewrite jsworld to work with cooperative and reentrant big-bangs
	Fix extraneous manual poll (after world stops) on text inputs (around line 1180 in jsworld/jsworld.js)
Add in missing jsworld procedures (on-mouse, on-mouse!, image-rotate)
Fix on-key for non-alpha-numeric keys (already works for \t, \b, enter, space, up, down, left, right)


* Low Priority *
Change printing of chars and byte strings so that it properly displays non-printable characters (as #\<number>)
Fix formatting of "wrong number of arguments" error
Make errors report what (other) arguments were given
