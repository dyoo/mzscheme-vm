This is a list of stuff that needs to get done


**** Very High Priority **** (stuff Emmanuel needs)
Fully test the following:
    on-redraw (pretty much done)
    programs Emmanuel sends us
Make sure all errors are emitting reasonable locations
Be able to save, publish, and run programs in WeScheme
Test for correctness on IE 6, IE 7, and IE 8
Robustly test all non-world primitives

Speed up WeScheme (page loads take forever)
put in vertical scroll bar on definitions window (and maybe interactions too?)


*** High Priority ***
Get primitives tested using PLT test suite
Test for performance on different platforms
Get effects working in jsworld again
Fix on-key so it recognizes shift being held down


** Medium Priority **
Get newlines to display properly with js-text
Rewrite jsworld to work with cooperative and reentrant big-bangs
	Fix extraneous manual poll (after world stops) on text inputs (around line 1180 in jsworld/jsworld.js)
Add in missing jsworld procedures (on-mouse, on-mouse!, image-rotate)
Add fields to errors to display arguments better (using toDomNode instead of toWrittenString)


* Low Priority *
Make errors report what (other) arguments were given
