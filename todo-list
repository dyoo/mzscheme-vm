This is a list of stuff that needs to get done


**** Very High Priority **** (stuff Emmanuel needs)
Fully test the following:
    on-redraw (pretty much done)
    programs Emmanuel sends us
Make sure all errors are emitting reasonable locations
Test for correctness on IE 6, IE 7, and IE 8
Robustly test all non-world primitives

Speed up WeScheme (page loads take forever)
put in vertical scroll bar on definitions window (and maybe interactions too?)


*** High Priority ***
Get primitives tested using PLT test suite
Test for performance on different platforms
Get effects working in jsworld again
Fix on-key so it recognizes shift being held down
Gracefully catch errors in procedure->{cps,void}-js-fun instead of just throwing


** Medium Priority **
Get newlines to display properly with js-text
Rewrite jsworld to work with cooperative and reentrant big-bangs
	Fix extraneous manual poll (after world stops) on text inputs (around line 1180 in jsworld/jsworld.js)
Add in missing jsworld procedures (on-mouse, on-mouse!, image-rotate)
Add fields to errors to display arguments better (using toDomNode instead of toWrittenString)


* Low Priority *
Make errors report what (other) arguments were given
Get make-struct-field-accessor and make-struct-field-mutator to return procs with correct names
