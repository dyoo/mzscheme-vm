Fixes:

    check-expect: check-expect now works by
    applying tests after all of the definitions and other expressions
    have evaluated.

    jsworld reentrancy: there was an issue where jsworld behaved badly
    (reverting to old worlds) if events came in at a rate faster than
    it could handle them.

    member: the definition of member can been corrected to return a
    boolean in the WeScheme (Moby) languages.

    miscellaneous fixes: corrected errors involving
    struct-mutator-procedure, exn structures constructors, and some
    arithmetic edge cases.

new:
    exposed the struct-out form for provides.
