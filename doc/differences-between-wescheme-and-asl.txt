Here are deviations from ASL:


unmatched cond falls through

unmatched case falls through

branch expressions are not test for booleans at test position

+, *, / don't take at least two arguments.

and, or, nand, nor don't require at least two arguments

set! allowed on function arguments

syntactic keywords can be used as variable names
